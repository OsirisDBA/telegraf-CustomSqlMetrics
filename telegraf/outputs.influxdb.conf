# Configuration for influxdb server to send metrics to
[[outputs.influxdb]]

  # The full HTTP or UDP endpoint URL for your InfluxDB instance.
  # Multiple urls can be specified but it is assumed that they are part of the same
  # cluster, this means that only ONE of the urls will be written to each interval.
  # urls = ["udp://127.0.0.1:8089"] # UDP endpoint example
  urls = ["https://someendpoint"] # required

  # The target database for metrics (telegraf will create it if not exists)
  database = "telegraf" # required

  # Precision of writes, valid values are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  # note: using second precision greatly helps InfluxDB compression
  precision = "s"

  ## Write timeout (for the InfluxDB client), formatted as a string.
  ## If not provided, will default to 5s. 0s means no timeout (not recommended).
  timeout = "5s"

  # Authentication
  #username = "telegraf"
  #password = "L(ciL)mXq1l*"
  
  # Set the user agent for HTTP POSTs (can be useful for log differentiation)
  user_agent = "telegraf"
  
  # Set UDP payload size, defaults to InfluxDB UDP Client default (512 bytes)
  # udp_payload = 512
